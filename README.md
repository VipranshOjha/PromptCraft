# PromptCraft

**Turn simple ideas into powerful, expert-crafted AI prompts.**

💬 **The Problem**
When I used AI assistants like Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude, I often had ideas in mind but struggled to phrase them as clear, detailed prompts.

* If I wrote prompts casually → the AI gave vague or shallow results.
* If I tried to be precise → it took me too long to structure and refine.
* Online “prompt generators” I found were either too basic or locked behind premium paywalls.

I needed a tool that could:
✅ Transform vague ideas into **structured expert prompts**
✅ Work across multiple **domains** (coding, writing, academic, research, image gen, etc.)
✅ Be free, local, and customizable

---

✨ **The Solution**
That’s why I built **PromptCraft**.

It’s a web app that takes your **raw idea** and instantly transforms it into a **professional-grade AI prompt** with structure, persona, and style.

* Powered by **Google Gemini API**
* Backend written in **Flask** (your API key is safe)
* Beautiful frontend with **HTML/CSS/JS**

Now, in seconds, I can go from *“an idea”* → *“an expert-level AI prompt”* ready to use in Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, or any other AI platform.
